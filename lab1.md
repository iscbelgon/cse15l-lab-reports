In this lab report, I will be explaining the steps as to how to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6` through Visual Studios code and remotely connecting along with trying some commands within the remote conenction.

Through this report, we will be:

## Installation of Visual Studio Code
First we will go about installing Visual Studio code. Of course, the computers in the labs have visual studio installed on the computers. We, however, are interested in installing Visual Studio on our own computers. 

To download Visual Studio code, go to the official website
[https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
, download and install.
